This kit is a upgrade from \href{https://github.com/sunfounder/Sunfounder_Smart_Video_Car_Kit_for_RaspberryPi}{\texttt{ Sunfounder Smart Video Car Kit for Raspberry Pi}}. With wide angle camera, new motor driver, with-\/sensor-\/extension Robot HATS, makes this kit cleaner, much more beautiful and much more useful. Also, as motor driver has been change to TB6612\+FNG, this code is not compatible with Version 1.

This code is divided into two part, server and client. Server runs under Python 2 and Django 1.\+9, and client runs under Python 3 and Py\+Qt 5. Server side runs on Raspberry Pi, and you can run the client side on Windows and Linux (Haven\textquotesingle{}t test on Mac.). Also, you can control the car via web browser. Even though its not that better, but it works.

We are happy to see your issus and pull request. Feel free to be apart.
